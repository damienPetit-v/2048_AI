Project Title: 2048 AI Player

Description:  
This project is an implementation of the popular 2048 game in Python, accompanied by an AI player capable of playing the game autonomously using Monte Carlo algorithms.

Features:  
- Fully functional implementation of the 2048 game.  
- AI player implemented using Monte Carlo methods to play automatically.  
- Modular code structure for easy modifications and enhancements.  

Installation Instructions:  
1. Clone the repository  
   Run the following command in your terminal to download the code:  
   git clone <your_github_repository_link>  

2. Check for Python Installation  
   Open a terminal or command prompt and check if Python is installed by running:  
   python --version  
   or  
   python3 --version  

   - If a version number is displayed (e.g., Python 3.10.9), proceed to step 3.  
   - If you see an error (e.g., "command not found"), install Python by following these steps:  

   For Windows:  
   - Download the Python installer from the official website: https://www.python.org/  
   - Run the installer and ensure you check the option "Add Python to PATH" during installation.  

   For macOS/Linux:  
   - Use your package manager to install Python:  
     brew install python   # For macOS (using Homebrew)  
     sudo apt-get install python3   # For Ubuntu/Debian  
     sudo yum install python3       # For CentOS/RedHat  

3. Install dependencies  
   Install the required dependencies using pip. Run:  
   pip install numpy  

4. Run the program  
   Navigate to the directory containing the code and execute the script:  
   python 2048_ai.py  

   If python does not work, try:  
   python3 2048_ai.py  

Usage Instructions:  
1. The program will launch the 2048 game.  
2. The AI player will automatically play the game using Monte Carlo algorithms.  
3. You can modify the parameters of the AI algorithm in the script to test different strategies.  

Dependencies:  
- Python 3.x  
- numpy  
- tkinter
